# tec-Memory-Bank-Switching on the TEC-1

Analysis of memory bank controlling specifically for this TEC-1 Z80 system:

Memory Banking Considerations for the TEC-1 Z80 System:

1. Current Architecture Analysis:
The TEC-1 shown in the schematic uses a simple direct memory mapping with:
- 2732 EPROM (4KB)
- 6116 RAM (2KB)
- No existing bank switching capability

2. Potential Memory Bank Controller Upgrades:

A. 74LS612/74LS614 Integration:
- Could be added between the Z80 and existing memory chips
- Would allow expansion to 4 or 8 banks while maintaining compatibility
- Connection points:
  - Address lines would connect to the Z80's address bus before the current memory chips
  - Control signals would tie into the existing chip select logic
  - Data lines would integrate with the current data bus structure

B. Custom GAL/CPLD Solution:
- Could replace the current direct addressing scheme
- Would interface with:
  - The address bus after the Z80
  - The existing EPROM and RAM chip select lines
  - Additional memory chips in a banked configuration

C. Modified Design Using Existing Components:
- Utilize the unused pins on the 74C923 for basic bank selection
- Add additional RAM/EPROM chips with:
  - Chip selects controlled through decoded I/O ports
  - Address line manipulation for bank switching
  - Maintained compatibility with existing memory map

3. Implementation Considerations:
- The system's current design focuses on simplicity for educational purposes
- Any banking addition should maintain the ability to boot from the original EPROM
- Bank switching should be implemented through the Z80's I/O instructions to maintain software compatibility
- The existing display and keyboard interfaces must remain functional across bank switches

4. Recommended Approach:
For this specific TEC-1 design, the most appropriate memory banking upgrade would be:
- Start with a simple 74LS612-based solution
- Maintain the original memory map in bank 0 for compatibility
- Add additional RAM/EPROM in higher banks
- Use existing I/O port space for bank selection registers

#  74LS612-based solution

I'll detail the implementation of a 74LS612-based memory banking solution for the TEC-1 Z80 system.





# 74LS612 Memory Banking Implementation for TEC-1

## Hardware Implementation

### Components Required
- 74LS612 Memory Management Unit
- Additional 6116 RAM chips (2KB each)
- Additional 2732 EPROM chips (4KB each)
- 74LS138 3-to-8 decoder for chip selection
- Bypass capacitors (0.1µF)

### Memory Map Configuration
Bank 0 (Original Configuration):
- 0000h-0FFFh: Original 2732 EPROM
- 1000h-17FFh: Original 6116 RAM
- 1800h-1FFFh: I/O Space

Banks 1-3:
- 0000h-0FFFh: Banked EPROM/RAM
- 1000h-17FFh: Banked RAM
- 1800h-1FFFh: Common I/O Space (non-banked)

### Hardware Connections

1. 74LS612 Pin Connections:
```
Pin 1  (A0) -> Z80 A0
Pin 2  (A1) -> Z80 A1
...
Pin 15 (A14) -> Z80 A14
Pin 16 (A15) -> Z80 A15

Pin 17 (BS0) -> Bank Select Latch bit 0
Pin 18 (BS1) -> Bank Select Latch bit 1
Pin 19 (EN) -> Z80 MREQ (inverted)
Pin 20 (GND) -> Ground
Pin 21 (Y15) -> Memory Chip Select Logic
Pin 22 (Y14) -> Memory Chip Select Logic
...
Pin 39 (Y0) -> Memory Chip Select Logic
Pin 40 (VCC) -> +5V
```

2. Bank Selection Circuit:
```
Port FFh (Write) -> Bank Select Latch
D0, D1 -> BS0, BS1 of 74LS612
```

## Software Implementation

### Bank Selection Code
```assembly
; Bank switching routine
; Input: A = bank number (0-3)
SELECT_BANK:
    PUSH AF
    AND  03h         ; Mask to ensure valid bank (0-3)
    OUT  (0FFh),A   ; Write to bank select port
    POP  AF
    RET

; Example usage
    LD   A,1        ; Select bank 1
    CALL SELECT_BANK
```

### Memory Access Example
```assembly
; Read from banked memory
READ_BANKED:
    PUSH AF
    LD   A,2        ; Switch to bank 2
    CALL SELECT_BANK
    LD   A,(1000h)  ; Read from banked RAM
    POP  AF
    RET
```

### Initialization Code
```assembly
; System initialization with banking
INIT:
    LD   A,0        ; Select bank 0 (default)
    OUT  (0FFh),A
    ; Continue with normal initialization
```

## Integration Notes

1. Power-On Configuration:
- System defaults to Bank 0 on reset
- Original ROM/RAM accessible for boot sequence
- Bank switching enabled after initialization

2. Important Considerations:
- All bank switching code must reside in common memory
- Interrupt vectors remain in Bank 0
- Stack should be in non-banked memory
- Critical routines should be in common memory

3. Performance Impact:
- Bank switching takes 2 cycles (OUT instruction)
- No wait states required for 74LS612
- Minimal impact on system performance

4. Software Design Guidelines:
- Use bank 0 for OS and common routines
- Banks 1-3 for application code/data
- Maintain bank tracking in software
- Save/restore bank state when necessary

## Debugging Support

1. Bank Status Display:
```assembly
SHOW_BANK:
    IN   A,(0FFh)   ; Read current bank
    AND  03h        ; Mask to bank number
    CALL DISPLAY    ; Show on system LEDs
    RET
```

2. Bank Verification:
```assembly
CHECK_BANK:
    LD   A,055h     ; Test pattern
    LD   (1000h),A  ; Write to current bank
    LD   A,0AAh     ; Different pattern
    LD   B,A        ; Save pattern
    CALL SELECT_BANK
    LD   A,(1000h)  ; Read back
    CP   B          ; Compare
    RET
```


This implementation provides several key advantages for the TEC-1:

1. Backward Compatibility:
- Maintains original memory map in Bank 0
- Preserves all existing TEC-1 software functionality
- Allows gradual migration to banked memory

2. Expandability:
- Adds up to 24KB additional memory (3 banks × 8KB)
- Supports mixed RAM/ROM configurations
- Maintains simple I/O structure

3. Educational Value:
- Demonstrates memory management concepts
- Provides hands-on experience with bank switching
- Introduces advanced Z80 programming concepts
